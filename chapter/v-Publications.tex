\markboth{Publications}{}

During the course of my research, I coauthored the following publications. I briefly describe my contribution to these papers.

\begin{itemize}
\item \bibentry{CliftonEverest:2014:acc-ffi}

  Contains a description of my work in designing and implementing a foreign function interface for Accelerate (Section \ref{sec:acc-intro}). It explains and justifies the design and evaluates it through a series of benchmarks. This work can be found in this dissertation in Section~\ref{sec:foreign}.

\item \bibentry{Madsen:2015}

  Describes joint-work with myself and Frederick Meisner Madsen on \emph{regular} sequences (Section~\ref{chap:motivation}) and their introduction to Accelerate. The design philosophy is explored along with motivating examples and benchmarks. My primary contribution was in how programs exploiting sequences could be flattened (Section~\ref{sec:ndp}).

\item \bibentry{CliftonEverest:2017:streaming}

  Builds upon my work in the above by introducing \emph{irregular} sequences and how they relate to flattening. This dissertation goes into detail on this work in \Cref{chap:theory,chap:implementation,chap:Evaluation}.
\end{itemize}
