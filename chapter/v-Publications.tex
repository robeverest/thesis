\Exam{Publications if would be nice to be explicit here about the thesis author's contributions, especially for the second paper, where the thesis author is not the first author.}
During the course of my research, I coauthored the following publications:

\begin{itemize}
\item \bibentry{CliftonEverest:2014:acc-ffi}
\item \bibentry{Madsen:2015}
\item \bibentry{CliftonEverest:2017:streaming}
\end{itemize}
