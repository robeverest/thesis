\begin{center}
My supervisors, Gabi and Manuel, for their expertise and support throughout a long 5 years.

\qquad

My family, not for any expertise, but certainly for their support, for an even longer period.

\qquad

More broadly, the Programming Languages and Systems group at UNSW: Gabi, Manuel, Trevor, Amos, Ben, Liam, Zilin, and the many others who came and went in my time there. Their support and advice were invaluable. Being a member has been a formative experience for me. Sadly the group is coming to an end as its members move on to better opportunities. It will not, however, be forgotten. It has too great a legacy for that.
